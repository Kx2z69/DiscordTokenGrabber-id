> # __**VENAX DISCORD TOKEN GRABBER**__<br>


For people that constantly ask me to update it so it can decrypt the new Discord clients tokens, I already did it thanks to @NobodyWouldEverUseThis7
I tested it and it is working, so the grabber already has already been updated, and upgraded, for me.
Unfortunately, after being "skidded" every time I made programs, I don't really want to share my codes again, being generous was a loss of time, just make your codes by yourself, it will make you better at programming, good luck for the future, cordially, venax.

> **NOTES**
I updated all old Discord API versions on request links.
For the account connections (linked accounts) like YouTube, Steam, Github...
I could not use get function because converting it in dictionary is very hard because Discord API
give it as list of dictionaries and I tried to split them but it was to difficult.
Apart from that I added to the token grabber victim's account biography as footer text.
I also managed to get banner as gif / png in the embed, I found that it was almost the same
as avatar link but it was /banners/userid/bannerid instead of /avatars/userid/avatarid.
And finally for linked accounts I still put them in the token grabber but only deleting
the characters of list and dictionary to make it look more understandable.
Thanks you if you found some solutions, send it in the Github pull requests.
